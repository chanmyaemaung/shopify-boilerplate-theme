# SHOPIFY 1.0 - BOILERPLATE DEVELOPMENT THEME

This is the theme dev I use for all my Shopify projects. It's a simple theme with a few basic features that I use on every project. It's a great starting point for any Shopify project. So you covert your **Shopify 2.0** json template files to liquid files and start building your theme.

The reason why I alway prefer to work with boilerplate theme instead of using Shopify latest Dawn theme because it's very easy to understand and customize. You can easily add/remove any section, block, snippet, etc. Also you can easily to implement your own logic and code without any hassle.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Update the `config.yml` file with your store details
3. Run `theme watch --allow-live` to start developing

## Important Notes

You have to install Shopify Theme Kit to run this theme. You can download it from [here](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/).
